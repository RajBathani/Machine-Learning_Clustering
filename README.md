# Machine-Learning_Clustering
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning task. It is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters.Clustering algorithms only interpret the input data and find natural groups or clusters in feature space.
